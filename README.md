# Capital-Bikeshare
The objective of this analysis is to use data related to Washington DCâ€™s bikeshare program to help Capital Bikeshare understand what factors impact the demand for bikes.
The data provided shows bikeshare activity from January 2011 through December 2012, and details key factors like when the bike was rented, what the weather was like, and whether the person renting the bike was a registered or casual user. 

After conducting exploratory analysis and linear regressions in R, we can see that bike rentals really soar in the warmer months, with most bike riders tending to use bikes to commute to and from work over leisure activity.
